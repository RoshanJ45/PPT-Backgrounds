       <div id="example1">
           <h2>Backgrounds Origin</h2>
           <p> Your present circumstances don’t determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.</p>
           <p> You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.</p>
           <p> The work you do when you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.</p>
       </div>
       
       <div id="example2">
           <h2>Multiple Backgrounds</h2>
           <p> One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals.</p>
           <p> The only person you should try to be better than, is the person you were yesterday.</p>
           <p> Much of the stress that people feel doesn’t come from having too much to do. It comes from not finishing what they’ve started.</p>
       </div>
       <div id="example3">
           <h2>CSS Background Size</h2>
           <p> The difference between a stumbling block and a stepping stone is how high you raise your foot.</p>
           <p> Study while others are sleeping; work while others are loafing; prepare while others are playing; and dream while others are wishing.</p>
           <p> If the decisions you make about where you invest your blood, sweat, and tears are not consistent with the person you aspire to be, you’ll never become that person.</p>
       </div>
       <div id="example4">
           <h2>CSS Background-clip</h2>
           <p> The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person’s determination.</p>
           <p> Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.</p>
           <p> You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.</p>
